ReadMe File

A Visual Studio Code extension that provides basic notebook support for language kernels that are supported in Jupyter Notebooks today, and allows any Python environment to be used as a Jupyter kernel. This is NOT a Jupyter kernel--you must have Python environment in which you've installed the Jupyter package, though many language kernels will work with no modification. To enable advanced features, modifications may be needed in the VS Code language extensions.

Setup:
pip install django 

python manage.py collectstatic

python manage.py runserver
